## Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually X and O) with the objective of getting three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. This project aims to implement a digital version of the Tic Tac Toe game with several features for an enjoyable gaming experience.

## Features

**Interactive User Interface** 
- The game provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface allowing players to easily interact with the game board.

**Two-player Mode** 
- Supports two human players competing against each other.
- Players take turns marking the grid with their symbols until one player achieves victory or the game ends in a draw.

**Winning Conditions** 
- The game detects and declares a winner when a player successfully marks three consecutive symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Restart Options**
- Provides options to restart the game, allowing players to start a new game without reloading the page.

**Responsive Design**
- Ensures the game interface adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices.

By incorporating these features, the Tic Tac Toe project aims to deliver an engaging and immersive gaming experience for players of all ages.
